# IROPS Command Center ✈️📊

**Goal:** Build an operations-style decision dashboard to monitor disruption risk, identify delay drivers, and recommend actions.

## What this delivers
- Disruption Risk Score (by airport / time / route)
- Hotspot map (where risk is concentrated)
- Driver breakdown (weather, congestion proxy, time-of-day, seasonality)
- "Do this now" actions panel (rules + expected impact logic)

## Stack
SQL • Python (pandas) • Power BI

## Status
In progress 🟡 — repo structure + KPI definitions first, then model + dashboard.

## Repo structure
- `notebooks/` (data prep, EDA, risk model)
- `dashboard/` (Power BI + screenshots)
- `report/` (metric contracts + executive deck)

## Next milestone
Publish v1 dashboard screenshots + baseline risk model.
